First, a compiler for a simple programming language is written using assembly. Using that, a compiler is written for a C-like language that includes features such as strong type checking, pointers (and all the pointer math) and user defined structures.

The compiler targets arm systems (originally a Raspberry pi 2B), running GNU/Linux.

See more info in [the docs](/compiler).
