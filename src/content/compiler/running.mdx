# Running the compilers
The compilers use GNU's assembler (*as*) and linker (*ld*) to transform generated assembly instructions into executables. 
For ease of use, the [Makefile](#makefile) may also be used.

Testing was done on a *Raspberry pi 2B*, but you may change the target CPU (or FPU) in the Makefile. 
Both (*p0* and *p1*) compilers generate ARM32 instructions.

## Running the bootstrap compiler
Input/output is done using *stdin*/*stdout*, for which you can use pipes. For example:
```bash
cat src/*.p0 | bin/p0 > bin/p1.s
as -mcpu=$CPU -mfpu=$FPU -o bin/p1.o bin/p1.s
ld -o bin/p1 bin/p1.o
```

## Running the p1 compiler
The same applies for the p1 compiler.
```bash
bin/p1 < test/src/helloworld.p1 > bin/test/helloworld.s
```

# Makefile
The **Makefile** can be used for many things:
```bash
// Bootstrapping the compilers
make all # compiles bin/p0, bin/p1 and the helper objects
```

```bash
// Compiling one of the test programs
make bin/test/helloworld
```

```bash
// Running one of the test programs
make helloworld
```

```bash
// Running a test
make test/helloworld
```

```bash
// Running all tests
make test
```
 
```bash
// Deleting the binaries
make clean
```

```bash
// Forcing a full recompilation
make clean all
# or
make clean test
# ...
```
