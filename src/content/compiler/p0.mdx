# Stage 0 compiler
> p0 -> assembly, written in assembly

Since this stage of the compiler is written in assembly, the p0 language will be kept fairly simple,
in order to keep the complexity down. It turned out that it was **too** simple initially, which is
why some additional features were added when I was revisiting this project (see commits
[8af7e8d](https://github.com/MrTipson/compiler/commit/8af7e8dad81ffc4150663385924f8d67d39c9c93)-[b27b91e](https://github.com/MrTipson/compiler/commit/b27b91eb0a192fca74725bfa921b788b57041464)).

The p0 language thus only consists of:
- assignments,
- keywords,
- and comments (starting at # and lasting until the end of the line).

Furthermore, the compiler does not preety print errors, relying solely on return values to signal them.

---

## Expressions
Expressions in the language are implemented using *postfix* or *reverse polish* notation, because it enables the use of 
complex expressions (subexpressions, operator priority) with a very simple implementation:
- variables load the value from memory and push it on the stack,
- number literals load the value in the register and push it on the stack,
- operators (**+**, **-**, **\***, **/**, **%**, **>**, **=>**, **\<**, **=\<**, **==**, **=!**, **&** or **|**) pop 
2 elements from thef stack and push the result back on.

> Note: **=\<**, **=>** and **=!** start with **=** to simplify some parsing logic.

Using the stack like this is excessive, but we don't have to worry about trashing intermediate values in the registers.
However, expression calculation does not use its own stack, so wrongly formulated expressions can cause the program to 
jump back to a garbage return address.

---

## Assignments
Assignments are of the form `var = <expr>`, and merely retrieve the result of an expression and store it into the variable.

---

## Keywords
To help distinguish between assignments and keywords, keywords are prefixed with **:**. Keywords
themselves are distinguished between themselves only by their first letter, further simplifying the
parsing process, while still allowing the usage of longer names, helping maintain code readability.

### Input/Output
The keywords in this category do not require any extraordinary treatment - for the most part, it is merely loading
an address (either of a variable or the string literal), and using that (along with some constants) to invoke a syscall.
String literals which appear in the keywords are saved in memory and emitted in the data segment at the end of the
produced assembly.

<figure>
Letter | Syntax | Functionality
--|--------|--------------
g | :getchar(*var*) | Read a character from **stdin** into *var*
p | :putchar(*var*) | Print a character from *var* to **stdout**
u | :uchar(*var*)   | Print a character from *var* to **stderr**
r | :raw(*string literal*) | Print a string to **stdout**
t | :throw(*string literal*) | Print a string to **stderr**
e | :exit(*expr*) | Stop execution with the result of *expr* as the status code
</figure>

For example, `:raw("Hello world")` would get compiled into:
<figure>
```asm
// test.asm
	mov r7,#4       @ Syscall (write)
	mov r0,#1       @ File descriptor (stdout)
	ldr r1,=s0      @ String address
	ldr r2,=slen0   @ String length
	svc 0           @ Invoke syscall

@ somewhere down the line
.data
s0: .ascii "Hello world"
slen0 = .-s0
```
</figure>


### Memory
Its worth to talk about how memory is handled in this very primitive language.

First of all, available variables are predetermined (**a**..**z**), and they are all stored in the data segment. When used, their address is loaded using labels.

General memory access is made available through keywords **load** and **store**, which manipulate the contents of
a linear array (the size of which is hardcoded in the compiler):

<figure>
Letter | Syntax | Functionality
--|--------|--------------
l | :load(*var*,*expr*) | Load value from memory array at location determined by *expr* into variable *var*
s | :store(*expr1*,*expr2*) | Store result of *expr1* to memory array at location determined by *expr2*
</figure>

For example `d = <expr>` (setting a variable) is compiled into:
<figure>
```asm
	pop	{r0}	    @ expression result
	ldr	r1,=d       @ load address of d in reg1
	str	r0,[r1]     @ store reg0 at address reg1
```
</figure>

For example, `:load(a,<expr>)` would be compiled as:
<figure>
```asm
	pop	{r0}	    @ expression result
	ldr r1,=a       @ load address of a in reg1
	ldr r2,=mem     @ load start of memory array
	ldr r0,[r2, r0, LSL #2] @ r0 = M[mem + 4*r0]
	str r0,[r1]     @ store value to variable a
```
</figure>


### Flow control
These 'keywords' were handled similarly to other actual keywords, but would traditionally be handled as separate
constructs (in the case of if, while and functions) or as part of expressions (call). 

<figure>
Letter | Syntax | Functionality
--|--------|--------------
i | :if(*\<expr>*)\{ ... \} else \{ ... \} | Conditional execution based on *\<expr>*
w | :while(*\<expr>*)\{ ... \} | Loop execution based on *\<expr>*
f | :fun(name)\{ ... \}   | Function
c | :call(name) | Function call
</figure>

Another thing they (*not including call*) have in common is that they all do something when their respective code block is closed (i.e. 'their' } is reached). In order to resolve which construct it belonged to, the stack is used to store the state, label number and chained if label. This meant that nesting of **if**, **else**, **else if** and **while** blocks was possible without much further hassle (okay, **functions** probably as well, but I never tried it).

##### Oh right, labels
Not much to say, except for the fact that they were prefixed with L, and suffixed by a label id.


Next, we'll take a look at the implementations for each of these keywords, although they are all quite similar.

#### If/Else/Else if
Conditional statements are implemented in the form of `:if(<expr>){ ... }`, `:if(<expr>){ ... } else { ... }` and 
`:if(<expr>){ ... } else if(<expr>) ...`. All variations start the same way, so if we take for example `:if(<expr>) {`, it would be compiled into:

<figure>
```asm
	pop r0			@ expression result
	cmp r0,#0       @ check if c == 0
	beq Lneg0       @ if so, jump to the negative label
	@ otherwise we fall through the positive branch
	@ ...
```
</figure>

At the same time, the compiler pushes the state, label id and chained label id (same as label id here) onto the stack, 
indicating that it is currently inside an if block.

Its worth noting that this way of implementing (positive branch follows check, negative is jumped to) is not by chance. 
It is done to keep the same order as in the source code, allowing all following statements to be directly compiled as well.

The cases of `} else {`, `} else if(<expr>) {` and `}` are covered in the [code block endings](#code-blocks).


#### While
Since while does not differentiate much from if, the description shall be quite brief.

`:while(<expr>) {`, would be compiled into:

<figure>
```asm
Lloop0:
	pop {r0}       @ expression result
	cmp r0,#0       @ check if c == 0
	beq Lloop_end0  @ if loop condition is false, jump to end
```
</figure>

In this case, we can notice the inclusion of the `Lloop` label, allowing the code at the end of the code block to 
jump back the condition check. Also, the loop condition is checked before any statements, as the expression is encountered before the loop body.

As before, the compiler also pushes the state, label id and chained if id, to indicate that its currently inside a while block.


#### Function
Functions are also quite simple (since the language does not accomodate for arguments). For example, `:fun(main){` would compile into:

<figure>
```asm
Fmain:          @ functions are prefixed with F
	push {lr}   @ save return address onto stack
```
</figure>

The compiler also pushes the state, label id and chained if id onto the stack (*both ids are set to -1, since compiling 
functions doesn't need them*).

##### Function calls
Since there are no arguments to take care of, function calls are just translated to their assembly equivalent.
<figure>
```asm
	bl  Fmain   @ call main function
```
</figure>


#### Code blocks
It is time to take care of code block endings. When the compiler reaches the end of a code block ( **}** ), 
it must first determine which state its in, which is done by retrieving the state, label id and chained if id from the stack.

##### If
If the code block belonged to an if statement, the compiler generates the footer for the positive branch:
<figure>
```asm
	b   Lend0   @ skip negative branch
.pool
Lneg0:          @ label for negative branch
```
</figure>

After that, it determines if there is an else block present. If so, the state is changed to 'else', 
and pushed back to the stack along with the same label id, and the same chained if id.

If the compiler determines that it encountered an `else if` statement, it is treated as a normal if,
except that the old chained if id is used for the id of the **Lend** label, and is retained when pushing the state and ids on the stack.

If no else is present, the compiler also generates the end label using the id from the chained if id field. This way the 
end label is shared for all ifs in the chain:
<figure>
```asm
Lend0:          @ label for end
```
</figure>

##### Else
Since else is also a valid state (generated at the end of an if codeblock), it is also handled separately. 
It generates the same end label as above, but only after the statements for the negative branch have been compiled.

##### While
When the end of a while body is encountered, the following code is generated:
<figure>
```asm
b   Lloop0      @ loop condition check
Lloop_end0:         @ loop end
```
</figure>

##### Function
When the function ends, the following code is generated:
<figure>
```asm
	pop {lr}        @ retrieve return address
	bx  lr          @ return from function
.pool               @ generate literal pool
```
</figure>

##### We're going swimming?
You might have noticed the `.pool` directive in the generated assembly. It instructs the GNU assembler to place a literal 
pool at the specified location, which is needed in arm32 assembly for loading some constants from memory 
(if a constant is too big to fit as immediate operand - mostly a limitation for the 32bit systems). This ensures that literal 
pools are *close enough*.

---

## Lessons
Initially, the **p0** language was a bit underpowered:
- expression limitations (simple assignments with at most 1 operator)
- if cascades (without `else if`, the resulting code had *pyramids of doom*)

These problems were taken care of when I revisited the project recently (about 2000 lines of code were removed as a result).
Still, some problems still exist, and might be worth looking at in the future:
- code organization
> My assembly code is not very clean, and could use a rewrite.
- variable limitations
> Using variables a-z is quite confusing. Allowing longer variable names would probably improve readability.

Not everything is bad though; functions, loops, i/o and memory are all good enough, and you can end up getting used to them.
